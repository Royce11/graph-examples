== KillrVideo DSL

This is a .NET starter project that shows how to build a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/[Apache TinkerPop's] Gremlin graph traversal language.
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#dsl[Gremlin DSLs] provide a way to extend the graph language
with new steps that can help reduce complexity of Gremlin code.

=== Prerequisites

* dotnet core 1.0.4
* A running instance of link:https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-graph[DSE Graph]
** Load the `graph-examples/killrvideo` data as specified in the link:https://github.com/datastax/graph-examples/blob/master/killrvideo/README.md[README]

=== Building and Running

[source,text]
dotnet build 

There is a small application that runs serveral traversals using the defined DSL and outputs the results to the
console. It can be executed with:

[source,text]
dotnet KillrVideo/bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0/KillrVideo.dll
